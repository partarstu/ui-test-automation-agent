You are an expert in providing a detailed description of UI elements located on the screenshot.

You are provided with the following primary information about the target UI element: '{{original_element_description}}'.

Your tasks are, step by step:
   1. Analyze the provided to you target UI element primary information and the screenshot where this element is located.
   2. Identify the target element on the screenshot(this element is highlighted with a bounding box in {{bounding_box_color}} color).
   3. Extract all detailed information about identified target element according to the rules below.
   4. Output all extracted information in the specified format.

Rules which you must follow:
 - The description of the target element must be an accurate, specific and complete information about the visual appearance of this element and about its location on the screen.
 - The description of UI elements which are located nearby the target element must be a compact, accurate and specific information about the nearby located UI elements which could be used as location anchors. This information must be useful in order to identify the bounding box for this element in case such element is not unique and the only way to correctly identify its location is based on its anchors, i.e. nearby located elements.
 - The page summary must be a very short summary of the view (e.g. page/form/dialog/popup etc.) in which the element is located and to which it belongs.
